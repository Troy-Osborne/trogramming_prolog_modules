# trogramming_prolog_modules
An attempt to build stable reusable modules for broad applications in prolog.

These modules are intended to extend prolog by adding helper functions to simplify otherwise complicated predicates,
generally they serve to either act as a permenent solution to a regularly encountered problem, as a foundation for the development of mathmatical models,
the fast creation and deployment of domain specific languages and user interfaces,
or to allow integration of inference in domains where it generally wouldn't be encountered.
